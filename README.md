This is Single Linked List implementation using C 
Singly Linked List Implementation in C
Overview
This project implements a Singly Linked List in C, providing various operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and displaying the list. The program allows dynamic memory allocation for nodes and gives users an interactive menu to manage the linked list efficiently.

Features
The program supports the following operations:

Create a Linked List – Allows the user to create a list by entering elements.
Display the List – Prints the elements in the list.
Insertion Operations
At the beginning
At the end
Before a given node
After a given node
Deletion Operations
From the beginning
From the end
A specific node
A node after a given node
Search for an Element – Finds whether a value exists in the list.
Exit the Program – Terminates execution.
